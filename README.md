# parachute

Parachute is a tool which lets you airdrop SPL tokens to a list of wallet addresses (potentially sponsored by https://solrazr.com/)

Deployed at https://parachute.vercel.app, but it is recommended that you run your own instance so that you don't have to trust any deployment

## How to run your own instance

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/exogenesys/parachute`
2. Run `cd parachute`
3. Run `npm i`
4. Run `npm run serve`
5. Go to `localhost:5000` in your browser

## Notes on Security

- The app uses only official Solana libraries for the entire airdrop logic, i.e. @solana/spl-token, @solana/web3.js
- There is no server anywhere involved in the data-flow of this application, and the deployment on Vercel is static file serving deployment, so none of your data leaves the client side
- The application is open-sourced and to be audited by the community
- The solana related code is decoupled from the rest of the app and entirely written in these two files:
  - https://github.com/exogenesys/parachute/blob/main/src/services/SolanaService/index.ts
  - https://github.com/exogenesys/parachute/blob/main/src/services/AirdropService/index.ts
- Although, the application is deployed at https://parachute.vercel.app, It is recommended to run your own instance of the application so that you know that youâ€™re running the exact same code as you see on Github and you donâ€™t have to trust any deployment
- If you decide to go with the deployment at https://parachute.vercel.app, you can verify the deployments here on the following page: https://github.com/exogenesys/parachute/deployments/activity_log?environment=Production
- The app doesnâ€™t use any persistent client side storage option like localstorage, everything is stored in memory which is forgotten by the app after closing the tab or reloading

## Notes on Scalability

- The app is potentially capable of doing as many airdrops as you want
- Given that the RPC nodes used allows that as well
  - Public RPC nodes are prone to be congested, so speed may be affected
  - Public RPC nodes might rate limite you after a certain number of transfers
  - This is can easily be solved by using private RPC nodes

## Roadmap

- Allow connecting to mainnet
- Allow connecting via custom RPC Nodes
- Estimate and show how much SOL you'd need to do an airdrop
- Fetch wallet address which hold a certain SPL token
- Use electron to make a desktop app
- Dark Mode ðŸŒš
